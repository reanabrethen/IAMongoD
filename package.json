Inside the `product` folder, create a file named `productsRouter.js` and ensure its integration in `app.js`. The path should be `/api/products`.\r 3. Within the `product` folder, establish two additional folders named `model` and `controller`.\r 4. In the `model` folder, create a file named `Product.js`, and in the `controller` folder, create another file named `productController.js`.\r 5. In `Product.js`, include only `productName` with the type set to stringâ€”refer to the existing code for guidance.\r 6. In `productController.js`, implement the following functions: `createProduct`, `getAllProducts`, `getProductByID`, and `updateProductByID`.\r 7. Integrate these functions in `productsRouter.js` with reference to the existing code.",
